Quick note is a minimalist rich text editor with markdown shortcuts built ussing [slatejs](https://docs.slatejs.org/).

The notes are saved through an graphql api running on [Apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/), the graphql api was written using an Code-First approach using the library [NexusJS](https://nexusjs.org/).


The database is running on [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) and the project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM.
